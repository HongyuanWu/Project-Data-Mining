This project is done as part of Statistical Data Mining Coursework and dataset has been selected from Kaggle.

Cervical Cancer dataset showcases one of the common healthcare dataset problems i.e. IMBALANCE DATASET.
This was an unsupervised problem that has been converted to supervised learning problem. Data Set contains result of
4 medical tests based on which target variable has been created i.e. how likely is a person to have cancer.

Out of the total population, very few people would have the likelyhood of having a cancer which is why samples in the class
of people having cancer is very few. Thus to rectify it, the 2 methods that can be implemented is over-sampling or undersampling.
Since, the data has only 11k rows (approx), therefore I prefered over-sampling.
